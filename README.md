# Sweet, but how do I use them?

Follow through the instructions in the "Setup" section, then actually test your project by following the "Automatic Testing" section.

## Setup

As recommended time and time again by the teaching staff, it is highly recommended you do your testing from an eceubuntu server.
Steps to connect to such a server are beyond the scope of this README.

Once you're logged into an eceubuntu server (or a local Unix/Linux system of your own), clone this repository:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/JZJisawesome/ece250-testcases
Cloning into 'ece250-testcases'...

Resolving deltas: 100% (366/366), done.
```

If you already have a checkout but want to get the latest testcases and AutoGrader fixes, you can do this instead (from within your previous clone):

```
$ git pull

## Automatic Testing

The autograder implementation included in this repo, called the Jekel AutoGrader, **must be run from the repo root directory**.
Note down the path to your submission tarball, and open a terminal **in the root of the repo**. You can then test your tarball with

```
$ python3 ./jekelautograder.py path/to/your/tarball/example_p1.tar.gz
     _      _        _      _         _         ____               _
    | | ___| | _____| |    / \  _   _| |_ ___  / ___|_ __ __ _  __| | ___ _ __
 _  | |/ _ \ |/ / _ \ |   / _ \| | | | __/ _ \| |  _| '__/ _` |/ _` |/ _ \ '__|

Performing some basic sanity checks before we get started...
Looking good, I think I'm set to go!

To begin, let's check your tarball's file name and path...
Excellent! Based on the name of the tarball, example_p1.tar.gz, I've deduced the following:
Your UWID is: example
Your tarball is for: Project 1
[...]
```

The autograder will then test your tarball not only on the testcases for the correct project, but it will also check some other things:

- That the tarball is named correctly (it must be in order for the script to successfully infer the project version)
- That your design document is present and named correctly (matches the uwid in your tarball's name, etc.)
- That your Makefile is present and successfully produces an a.out file
- That you didn't accidentally include a precompiled a.out file in your tarball
- That your tarball dosn't contain any directories

Just like the real thing, the autograder will use Valgrind, so it is quite good at catching mistakes!

(It uses Leaks on MacOS)

## Manual Testing

This is useful if you are debugging an issue with your code that is triggered by a particular test case

The projects/ folder contains several subdirectories, one for each project.
Within the project folder you're interested in, there is an "input" and an "output" folder.

Each file in "input" is a testcase you can run with the following command (assuming you have
Valgrind installed and your code is compiled to the binary a.out)

```
$ valgrind ./a.out < path/to/testcase.in
[...]
```

You can then compare the results to the corresponding file in the "output" folder to ensure your program produces the correct output!

# Testcase Descriptions

## Project 3

| Testcase | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| alphabetic_print | Loads the corpus and prints it. A good way to check your are printing correctly in alphabetical order. |
| can_you_count | Testcase to test the count prefix command. |
| chatgpt_autogenerated_{0, 1, 2} | These are testcases autogenerated by ChatGPT, with some manual fixes. They can be hit or miss with regards to their utility in debugging/testing. |
| dont_erase_too_much | Erases words and ensures you don't accidentally erase other ones by mistake. Also makes sure your size variable remains consistent with the number of words present. |
| double_erase | Erases a word twice and ensures the behaviour is as expected |
| erasing_clear | Loads the corpus and clears it, then prints, inserts and removes to the empty trie. |
| illegal_erase | Attempt to erase a word with both valid and invalid characters to ensure the valid characters stay unerased |
| illegal_insert | Input a word with both valid and invalid characters to ensure the valid letters are not inserted |
| illegal_prefix | Input a prefix with both valid and invalid characters to ensure prefixes are counted properly and error messages are prioritized |
| insanity | JZJ's classic insanity test. This is the biggest one yet (almost 1 MB), but it shouldn't take that long since the trie is pretty efficient as data structures go! |
| im_empty_inside | Tests to ensure commands work properly when the trie is empty. |
| invalid | Tests how you handle invalid input for i, c, and e. |
| LEARN_test0{1, 2, 3, 4} | Tests provided by the ECE 250 Teaching Staff (from LEARN). |
| long_words | Tests words that are much longer than normal. |
| more_spellchecking | A few additional spellcheck commands I sort of accidentally came up with while trying to create spellcheck_no_suggestions. |
| multiload | Performs multiple loads and clears, using empty and size to ensure everything worked |
| nested_erase | Inserts a word and another word embedded in the previous word and erases both words. |
| prefix_example_from_spec | Tests the example situation mentioned in the spec on LEARN, with CAR, CARD, and CARMEN. |
| prefix_peril | Tries the "c" command in a bunch of situations, trying to invoke edgecases (ex. no prefixes available, the prefix is a valid word, the prefix is near the root, etc). |
| sanity | JZJ's classic sanity test. Just a single line: "exit" |
| single_letters | A testcase that inserts, removes, and prints several words that are only 1 letter long. |
| spellcheck_correct | Loads the corpus, and spellchecks every word, which should print "correct" each time. |
| spellcheck_example_from_spec | Tests the example situation mentioned in the spec on LEARN, with YOU, YOUN, YOUNG, and YOUR. |
| spellcheck_no_suggestions | Loads the corpus, and spellchecks several wrong words that have no suggestions. This is an edge case: newlines should be printed, **not all of the words**. |
| spellcheck_incorrect | Loads the corpus, and spellchecks several wrong words, trying to cover several edge cases when searching for suggestions. |
| YodaErase | A small testcase that ensure things still work, even with entirely unique words. |

## Project 4

| Testcase | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| fm_01 | Loads the graph example from Chapter 23 of CLRS. A standard check for the MST and cost calculations. |
| fm_02 | Ensure the cost function actually calls MST in order to calculate the cost each time (it dosn't just cache the value from the last MST call). |
| fm_03 | Ensure the MST is updated correctly when a connected graph has a vertex deleted such that it becomes disconnected, and then the relevant edge is re-added with a different weight. |
| im_empty_inside_again | Tests to ensure your graph behaves well when it is empty |
| integer_limits | Tests to ensure your code can handle input near the signed integer limits |
| invalid | Tests to ensure your code correctly rejects invalid vertex numbers and weights |
| LEARN_{smallGraph, testFull} | Tests provided by the ECE 250 Teaching Staff (from LEARN). Note LEARN_testFull uses the LEARN_bigGraph dataset. |
| sanity | JZJ's classic sanity test. Just a single line: "END" |
| update_adjacent_adjacency_lists | Ensure that, when you remove a vertex, the adjacency lists of verticies that were adjacent to the vertex are updated too. |
| vertex_weight_limits | Tests to ensure your code works correctly even when vertex numbers and weights are near their minimums and maximums. |

| Dataset | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| empty.in | The dataset with no edges in it |
| fm_CLRS_example.in | The graph example from Chapter 23 of CLRS, used by the fm_01 testcase. |
| fm_dataset_01.in | Dataset for use with the fm_02 testcase |
| fm_dataset_02.in | Dataset used by fm_03. |
| LEARN_bigGraph.in | Dataset provided by the ECE 250 Teaching Staff (from LEARN). |
| jzj_standard_{big, insanity, medium, normal, tiny}.in | JZJ's standard datasets (of various sizes) used by his testcases (and free for others to use for their testcases too!) |
